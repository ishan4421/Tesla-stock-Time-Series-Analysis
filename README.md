# Tesla-stock-Time-Series-Analysis

I downloaded this dataset from Kaggle. 
This dataset contains Tesla stock price details Date, OPEN, CLOSE, HIGH, LOW, VOLUME. 
This notebook tells about how to actually create graphs and do Time-Series analysis on stock data. 

Also these kinds of hot-stocks are very variable. Better to take stocks which are free from people's sentiments.
